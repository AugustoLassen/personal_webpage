      I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network’s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

    summary: |
      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

I obtained my Ph.D. degree in astrophysics in 2024, at Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS, BR), with a six-month split-site Ph.D. program at Stockholm University. Currently, I am a researcher at the Istituto Nazionale di Astrofisica (INAF), Osservatorio Astronomico di Padova, Italy.

My research interests lie in extragalactic astronomy, with a focus on galaxy formation and evolution, the physical and chemical properties of ionized gas, star formation in dwarf galaxies, and the influence of environment on galactic evolution.
